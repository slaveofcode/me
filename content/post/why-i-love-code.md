I always remember when started to write code, it was on highschool writing my very first pascal code and competing with another students to show them that my program was better than theirs. That's the time I found my self useful and very very exited to finish and gaining the response about my program.

Code was my friend since then. Nothing could make me happier than sitting in front of the monitor through the day on my school lab. When we go to there just to playing games, I'm doing some coding with Visual Basic and Java instead, so nerdy huh?

I never found myself into sadness and problem when I typing on my keyboard, producing lines of code was my faith that day. My friend also asking me why I really love to write code, why me so curious and never bored to creating a new program. I never said the answer.

Why do I so much like to do a programming? this question is hard to answer, because I like about what I think it is peaceful, worth to do and also I felt life is more fun when I doing it. Programming was taken me so long through some adventures and several real life problem where I could solve and deliver solution better.

Programming is never hurting me, because I always found a way to solve it. In a short sentence programming or coding is the reflection of yourself, because if you found it hurting, that means you don't understand what you want or how you make it happen. Life is simple, as simple as you write one procedure or function, if you mess with that function the disaster will come eventually.

Programming also makes you growing and scaling the way you think, it guides you crossing concepts and technique. You must following the patters, sometimes you looking at the rules, so you don't come outside of the boundaries. Then when you found the program is working, you finished with graceful.

So do I ever felt stressful or angry about this activities? Sure I am, but this a part of the life, as a human we moving up and down, make this part of our experience so we could be more better person when this situation come out in the future, also not all mistakes is our foult right? we just like scientist, knowing there is a problem and we help to solve. We make other person life better and efficient, we help our company growing and we help the ecosystem being useful with all of the results.

Over the decades, code was so much helped on industries today. The result of programming was so high, even you found it very massive affecting bussines, technology, learning program etc. Ya you hear it right, ever you thinking the sattelite, rocket, your smartphone, linux, banking system there are just a tiny part of the result. So you thinking that your part is just writing a code and get payment from your company? no man, You so much worthead than that.

I always saying to myself when I struggling to my program or when thinking the new method or best practice about my code. If I could life on computer or digital system, it would be more fun, because there is no problem without answer, or at least we always found a way to solve it, it never lies, never broke and show the real thing like a mirror of ours. I'm blessed to raised in this centuries, I never know what I'm gonna be if i live on 50's or 60's without computer, I should be a laziest person in the world on that time, getting sick and eaten by dogs.

Thanks to all people who make this day possible to live with technologies, computers and electronics. I owe my life to them.
