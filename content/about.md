A code explorer who loves to write code and seeking for open source artifacts *(read: project)* through the open internet world. I like to spent my free time to create some applications in order to heal my curiosity on technology, also interested to the content of the leadership, wonder someday i could built a product that help people and found my own startup company. 

Pretty much loves Javascript and Python, those two language really made my life better again. Also currently still watching on some possibility to expand on Golang. While almost 80% time of my daily activity was on my PC, i still believe that the world can be achieved based on your passion and interest on goodness. Keep your good work, cheers!
